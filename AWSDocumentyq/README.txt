This version downloads the yq binary from S3 and sets the appropriate permissions, then it downloads a file called commands.txt from S3 to the temporary directory, and executes the commands in that file using the xargs command. The xargs command reads the commands from the file and executes them one by one.

You will need to replace <S3_BUCKET_NAME> with the name of your S3 bucket, and make sure that the commands.txt file exists in the bucket and contains the commands you want to execute.
